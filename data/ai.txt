Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding.
 
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on large datasets.
 
Deep Learning (DL) is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. It is highly effective for image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks.
 
Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data such as images and videos. Applications include facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging.
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on enabling machines to understand and generate human language. It is used in chatbots, translation systems, and sentiment analysis.
 
Artificial intelligence is used in various industries such as healthcare (disease prediction), finance (fraud detection), and retail (recommendation systems).
 
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines AI, mechanical engineering, and electronics to design machines that can perform complex physical tasks.
 
Data Science combines statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights from structured and unstructured data.
 
The future of AI involves advancements in ethical AI, explainable AI, and AI governance to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.
